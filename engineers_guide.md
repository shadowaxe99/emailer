# Engineer's Guide

This document provides a guide for engineers to understand and work with the code for the Elysium Innovations pitch deck website.

## HTML

The `index.html` file contains the structure of the website. It uses standard HTML5 tags. Each section of the website is contained in a `div` element with a class for styling.

## CSS

The `style.css` file contains the styles for the website. It uses standard CSS3. Each section of the website has its own set of styles, and there are also global styles.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript files contain the functionality for the website. This includes the carousel and the roadmap. The carousel uses a simple JavaScript function to change the scroll position of the carousel container. The roadmap is currently a placeholder and will be implemented in the future.

## Running the Website

To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements include adding a pricing calculator, a forum, and more interactivity and animations. These will require additional JavaScript and possibly the use of external libraries or APIs.
